After a long time of hard work - and a lot of bugs - Codrex is finally public on its own domain! This means people will be able to publically view this post, (and of course the many more posts to come), the documentation on my personal and open-source projects, and more. As well as this, it's my birthday today! Two special things happening today, now.

I'd also like to thank the [Files Team](https://files.community/) for inspiration and help on this website. As well as this, I'd like to thank my family for helping me on the design; giving their preference.
